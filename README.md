# Detection-of-Faces-and-Eyes-of-a-Person-Using-Haar-Cascade-Classifiers
We are using Haar cascade classifier to detect faces and eyes from your webcam. 

Haar cascade is an object detection method that uses a series of classifiers (cascade) to identify objects in an image. 
They are trained to identify one type of object, however, we can use several of them in parallel e.g. detecting eyes and faces together. 

HAAR Classifiers are trained using lots of positive images (i.e. images with the object present) and negative images (i.e. images without the object present).

NOTE:  This project requires your computer to have a webcam
